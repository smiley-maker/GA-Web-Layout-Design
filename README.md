# GA-Web-Layout-Design

In this project, I use integer programming and genetic algorithms to create unique web designs using colored blocks. There are numerous guidelines for the genetic algorithm including placement constraints as well as good contrast for the color of the text block. Please see the attached paper for more information on my approach. 

## Instructions to Run: 
Start by running the following command in a terminal: 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command installs all dependencies necessary for the code. 

Next, run the following command. 

```
python main.py
```

This will run the genetic algorithm function using the parameters specified.
